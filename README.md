this was just a quick project to practice graphics in python. I plan on creating a few more games like this in python over time and eventually adding AI to them and setting that as the background to my computer.
if you want to play this then all you have to do is clone this repo then cd into it. then run python3 snake.py (may not be the same for you) then you can use wasd to move around.

edit. I have since done that, got bored of it running in the background and deleted my code without ever adding it to github.
